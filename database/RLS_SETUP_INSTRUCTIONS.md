# 🔐 RLS Setup Instructions for Assero.io

## 📋 Overview
This document provides step-by-step instructions to fix the Row Level Security (RLS) policies in Supabase for the Founders Circle application system.

## 🚨 Current Issue
- Founders Circle applications are failing due to RLS policy violations
- Server is using admin client as a workaround
- Need clean, production-ready RLS configuration

## ✅ Solution
We've created a comprehensive RLS solution that:
- Allows public inserts for Founders Circle applications
- Restricts other operations to authenticated users
- Provides admin role for full access
- Is production-ready and scalable

## 📝 Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Access Supabase Dashboard
1. Go to [https://supabase.com/dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard)
2. Select your Assero project: `jbfmdooljpcbzfjcewjs`
3. Navigate to **SQL Editor** in the left sidebar

### Step 2: Analyze Current State (Optional)
1. Copy the contents of `database/analyze_current_policies.sql`
2. Paste into SQL Editor and run
3. Review the current policies (for reference only)

### Step 3: Apply New RLS Configuration
1. Copy the contents of `database/production_rls_solution.sql`
2. Paste into SQL Editor
3. Click **Run** to execute the script
4. Wait for all commands to complete

### Step 4: Verify Success
You should see:
- ✅ All old policies dropped
- ✅ New policies created
- ✅ Test data inserted and deleted
- ✅ Success message: "RLS policies successfully configured for production!"

### Step 5: Test the Application
1. Go to your local server: `http://localhost:5173`
2. Navigate to the Founders Circle section
3. Submit a test application
4. Check server logs for success message

## 🔧 What the Script Does

### 1. Cleanup
- Drops all existing policies on `founders_applications` table
- Ensures clean slate for new configuration

### 2. Enable RLS
- Enables Row Level Security on the table
- Required for policies to work

### 3. Create Production Policies
- **Public Insert**: Anyone can submit Founders Circle applications
- **Authenticated Select**: Only logged-in users can view applications
- **Authenticated Update**: Only logged-in users can update applications
- **Authenticated Delete**: Only logged-in users can delete applications

### 4. Admin Role
- Creates `assero_admin` role for full access
- Grants admin privileges to authenticated users (development)
- In production, you'd grant this only to specific admin users

### 5. Verification
- Lists all created policies
- Tests insert/delete functionality
- Confirms everything works

## 🛡️ Security Features

### Public Access
- ✅ Anyone can submit Founders Circle applications
- ✅ No authentication required for submissions
- ✅ Perfect for landing page forms

### Protected Operations
- 🔒 Only authenticated users can view applications
- 🔒 Only authenticated users can update applications
- 🔒 Only authenticated users can delete applications
- 🔒 Admin role provides full access

### Scalability
- 📈 Easy to add new policies for future features
- 📈 Role-based access control ready
- 📈 Production-ready configuration

## 🚀 After Setup

### Server Changes
The server has been updated to:
- Use regular Supabase client (not admin)
- Rely on the new RLS policies
- Provide better error handling
- Log successful applications

### Benefits
- ✅ No more RLS policy violations
- ✅ Clean, maintainable code
- ✅ Production-ready security
- ✅ Scalable for future features

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### If Applications Still Fail
1. Check Supabase logs for specific error messages
2. Verify policies were created correctly
3. Ensure RLS is enabled on the table
4. Test with the provided test script

### If You See Policy Errors
1. Run the analysis script to see current state
2. Check if policies were created with correct names
3. Verify role assignments
